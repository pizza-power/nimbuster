# nimbuster
A directory and file enumeration utility written in nim.

Why did I create this program? I wanted to learn nim. Every other language has a directory/file enumeration program. I couldn't find one for nim, so here we are. 

clone this repo

compile nimbuster.nim

```nim c nimbuster```

run

``` nimbuster -u http://yourserverurl/ -w /path/to/your/wordlist```
